## ADRs

[0004: Closed Concepta Profile validator](adr/0004-closed-concepta-profile-validator.md) — Accepted. Closed validation, contextual review, registries, authored logs, and derived indexes.

[0006: Raw tier under references](adr/0006-raw-tier-under-references.md) — Accepted. Optional per-source storage for verbatim originals; each directory's index is the only Markdown inside the tier.

[0007: Percent-decoded index targets](adr/0007-index-targets-compared-percent-decoded.md) — Accepted. Compare relative URLs after decoding so real-world filenames stay expressible.

[0008: OKF finding contract](adr/0008-okfp-adopts-okf-finding-contract.md) — Accepted. Reuse OKF's finding report as the wire format and retire the separate load-issue channel.

[0009: Local knowledge retrieval](adr/0009-local-knowledge-retrieval.md) — Accepted. Keep Arctic XS for optional local embeddings; retain BM25 by default.

[0010: Wayfinder CLI](adr/0010-station-cli.md) — Accepted. Wayfinder validates, indexes and searches with local embeddings and persistent bundle snapshots.

[0011: Wayfinder MCP](adr/0011-station-mcp.md) — Accepted. Serve Wayfinder tools over local MCP stdio.

[0012: Wayfinder graph projection](adr/0012-wayfinder-graph-projection.md) — Accepted. Project the ordinary OKF graph; mermaid and DOT are text for an external preview.

[0013: Captures outside the bundle](adr/0013-captures-layer-outside-the-bundle.md) — Proposed. Separate source evidence and intake notes from maintained knowledge.

[0014: Local session memory and context](adr/0014-local-session-memory-and-context.md) — Proposed. Optional private memory and bounded local generation without changing bundle authority.
